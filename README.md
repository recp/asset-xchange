New file format to store 2d/3d assets for game and films

It will be a binary format, similar to COLLADA specs with more restrictions. COLLADA is very god spec but it appears as inactive standard in https://www.khronos.org/developers page.
So I decided to work on new format.

The extension will be **.ae** or maybe **.ax**?

Extension and name may be changed in the future.

[AssetKit](https://github.com/recp/assetkit) will be loader of this format. Or I may provide an alternative loader. 

I will push spec details over time.
