New file format t store 2d/3d assets for game and films

It will be a binary format similar to COLLADA specs with more restrictions. COLLADA is very god spec but it appears as inactive standard in https://www.khronos.org/developers page.
So I decided to work on new format.

The extension will be **.ae**

Extension and name may be changed in the future.

[AssetKit](https://github.com/recp/assetkit) will be loader of this format. Or I may provide alternative loader. 

I will work on this format but I will push spec details over time.
